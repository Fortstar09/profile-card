          <p>
            Meet Fortunate, a self-proclaimed lazy developer who loves finding
            ways to automate complex tasks often spending just as much time
            overthinking the process.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Heâ€™s a software developer focused on frontend and mobile
            development. Over the years, he has worked with various
            organizations and as a freelancer, helping clients build engaging
            website interfaces and mobile applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of coding, Fortunate is an interesting guy who enjoys
            reading manhwa (if you know, you know), watching movies, and
            occasionally diving into gaming when the mood strikes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heâ€™s popularly known online as xBlank a nickname born out of pure
            laziness (he couldnâ€™t think of anything else at the time) but one he
            hopes will find meaning someday.

          <p>
           My main goal in this internship is to assess my abilities and understand where I stand as a developer.

        <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
        <hr />
        <article class="description">
          <p>
            If thereâ€™s one area I feel truly confident in, itâ€™s turning designs into real, working code. Thereâ€™s just something deeply satisfying about taking a static design and bringing it to life, watching every layout, color, and animation come together exactly as envisioned. I genuinely enjoy that process of paying attention to the smallest details, making sure every spacing, alignment, and transition feels just right.

            Keep building, keep learning, and never stop improving. Each project, no matter how small, is a step toward mastery. I trust youâ€™re still building right, staying curious, experimenting, and enjoying the process. Growth takes time, but youâ€™ve got this! ðŸš€

          <p>
            I will make sure I give this internship my absolute best. Every stage, every challenge, and every task is a new opportunity to learn, grow, and become a better version of myself.
